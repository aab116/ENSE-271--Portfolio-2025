-General Thought Process
When figuring out the epics, I analyzed the chronological order of purchasing items in a grocery store. Firstly, I would go the grocery. In this case, it would be the grocery store application. After that, I browse for products and add items to the basket. I would have the similar functionalities for the online platform. Finally, I pay for the groceries and exit the grocery store. Regarding the application, I would provide the ability to pay online or in-person and provide delivery information. I also noticed that amazon provides customers with the ability to provide feedback in order to optimize user experience. 

-Decisions
1- In release 1.0, I believe having the ability to browse sales would be very delightful as it could increase sales in the account and improve the overall user experience.
2- In MVP release, I think having the ability to add products to basket would be pleasing.
3- In release 1.0, I believe having the ability to provide feedback is extremely beneficial in order to improve the quality of the application.

-Reason for Decisions
1- For browsing sales, I generally would tend to buy more products if they was a discount on the price. Therefore, adding a sales section would increase customer purchases.
2- For the basket, I often tend to forget what items I need. Therefore, I beleibe having a basket functionality would make the user experience more enjoyable.
3- In some cases, I would purchase a product and it would have some faults such as scratches. Therefore, I added the feedback functionality to inform the store about inconveniences in a product.

-How results are captured in story map

1- Instead of going to the sales aisle in a grocery store, the app provides a sales section that lists all the items that have a discount.
2- Just like shopping carts in a grocery store, the basket functionality allows shoppers to keep track of items.
3- In grocery stores, shoppers go to the customer support regarding inconveniences. Similary, the app would have the ability to add reviews regarding a product.

-Extra feature
1- The promo codes feature is an extra feature I thought of. The promo codes act as credit in the wallet, which is why I added the annotation "Depends on other". Basically, the shoppers would be able to purchase promo codes that they can sent to friends as gifts. I believe this functionality would increase the amount of users in the app. Although it has its positives, there are some risks that come with this functionality such as people randomly inputting promo codes that get approved for credit instead of purchasing them.
